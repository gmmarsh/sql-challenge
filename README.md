module 9 challenge

Contained within the EmployeeSQL repository is:
    - the entity relationship diagram
    - the table creation schema called DataEngineeringSchema.sql
    - the data analysis queries called DataAnalysis.sql

To create the DataEngineeringSchema.sql file the following steps were taken:
    - data types, primary keys and foreign keys were identified
    - the tables in the file are created in the order required to handle the foreign
    keys.
    - the tables were populated by importing each CSV file into its corresponding
    SQL table.
    
After the tables were populated, the DataAnalysis.sql file was run to carry out
data analysis tasks.
